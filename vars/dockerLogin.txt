<strong>dockerLogin()</strong>

<p>Uses AWS API to collect the ECR login information needed by subsequent docker commands.</p>
<p>
Calls <code>aws ecr get-login --region us-west-1</code> and runs the results as root to update the docker login credentials
for subsequent push/pull operations against our Elastic Container Repository service in AWS.
